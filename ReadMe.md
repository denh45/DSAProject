# SnapFood: An Online Food Delivery System

## Introduction
  #### In this project, we will develop an Online Food Delivery System using Python, highlighting the implementation and advantages of both linear and non-linear data structures. The system allows users to order food from various restaurants conveniently. 
  #### The ONLINE FOOD DELIVERY SYSTEM assumes effective use of linear and non- linear data structures to manage orders and menu searches. By using queues and tries, we aim to provide a balanced and efficient platform for both restaurant owners and customers. The chosen data structures are integral to the system&#39;s performance, ensuring fair order processing and quick access to menu items.

  ### Tools

## Conceptual Design

## Implementation
  ### Key Algorithms
  1. #### **Queue**
     #### To handle incoming food orders efficiently, we use a queue. The queue ensures that orders are processed on a first-come, first-served basis. This linear structure is simple and   helps maintain order fairness, ensuring customers receive their food in the sequence they ordered.
  2. #### **Prefix Tree (Trie)**
     #### For menu management and item searches, we will implement a trie (prefix tree). This non-linear structure allows for quick and efficient searches, making it easy for users to find menu items based on prefixes. The trie structure organizes menu items in a way that reduces search time, enhancing the user experience.
