# SnapFood: An Online Food Delivery System

## Introduction
  #### In this project, we will develop an Online Food Delivery System using Python, highlighting the implementation and advantages of both linear and non-linear data structures. The system allows users to order food from various restaurants conveniently. 
  #### The ONLINE FOOD DELIVERY SYSTEM assumes effective use of linear and non- linear data structures to manage orders and menu searches. By using queues and tries, we aim to provide a balanced and efficient platform for both restaurant owners and customers. The chosen data structures are integral to the system&#39;s performance, ensuring fair order processing and quick access to menu items.
